# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves training models on unlabeled data, meaning the input data points do not have corresponding target labels or outcomes. The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover underlying patterns, structures, or relationships in the data without any explicit guidance.

Popular Algorithms for Unsupervised Learning:

- **K-means Clustering:** It partitions data into k clusters based on similarity, aiming to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares. It is widely used for customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.

- **Hierarchical Clustering:** It builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging smaller clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or splitting larger clusters into smaller ones (divisive). It helps in understanding the structure of the data and identifying nested clusters.

- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** It groups together data points that are close to each other in density and separates outliers. It does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance and is effective for datasets with irregular cluster shapes.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** It is a dimensionality reduction technique that identifies the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data and projects the data onto a lower-dimensional space. It is useful for data visualization and feature extraction.

- **Association Rule Learning:** It discovers interesting associations or patterns in large datasets. One popular algorithm is the Apriori algorithm, which finds frequent itemsets and generates association rules. It is commonly used in market basket analysis and recommendation systems.

- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):** It is a dimensionality reduction technique that focuses on preserving local structure and is particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional space.
