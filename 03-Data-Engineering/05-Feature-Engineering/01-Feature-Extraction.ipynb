    "# Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction is the process of extracting meaningful and relevant information from raw data to form new features that can be used for machine learning models. In simpler terms, it involves selecting and transforming the most important characteristics of a dataset into a format that a machine learning algorithm can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in image processing, feature extraction may involve identifying edges, corners, and other patterns in the image that can be used to identify and classify objects. In natural language processing, feature extraction may involve transforming raw text data into a bag-of-words representation or using word embeddings to represent the text data."
