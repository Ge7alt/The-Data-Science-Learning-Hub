    "# Streaming Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming data processing is a method of processing continuous data streams, where data is generated continuously over time and needs to be processed in real-time or near real-time. This type of processing is commonly used in applications such as social media analytics, financial transactions, sensor data processing, and online advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of big data, streaming data processing can be performed using distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and Apache Storm. These frameworks provide a way to process continuous data streams in parallel across multiple nodes in a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic workflow for streaming data processing involves ingesting data from a source, processing the data, and then outputting the results. The data is typically processed in small batches or micro-batches, with each batch representing a small window of time. The processing can include tasks such as filtering, aggregation, and machine learning."
