# Statistics

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It involves methods for summarizing and describing data, making inferences and predictions, and testing hypotheses. Statistics plays a crucial role in scientific research, decision-making, business analytics, and many other fields.

## Types of Statistics:

1. **Descriptive Statistics:** Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and presenting data in a meaningful way. It includes measures such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics help in understanding the characteristics of a dataset and providing a concise summary.

2. **Inferential Statistics:** Inferential statistics involves making inferences or drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. It uses probability theory and statistical models to estimate population parameters, perform hypothesis testing, and assess the significance of results.
