For data science, the following topics of calculus are particularly useful:

- **Differential calculus:** This involves the study of rates of change and slopes of curves. In data science, it is important to understand the concept of derivatives to optimize models, calculate gradients, and find maximum or minimum values.

- **Integral calculus:** This involves the study of areas under curves and accumulation of values over time. In data science, integrals are used to calculate the total effect of a variable over time, such as the area under a ROC curve or the expected value of a random variable.

- **Multivariable calculus:** This involves the study of functions with more than one independent variable. In data science, multivariable calculus is used to optimize models with multiple parameters and to calculate gradients and Hessians.

- **Optimization:** This involves the study of maximizing or minimizing a function. In data science, optimization techniques are used to find the optimal values of parameters in machine learning models.

It is important to have a good understanding of these topics to be able to apply them effectively in data science.
