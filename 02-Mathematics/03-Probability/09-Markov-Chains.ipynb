    "# Markov Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov chain is a mathematical model used to study the behavior of a system that changes randomly over time. It is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov and consists of a sequence of random events or states, where the probability of transitioning to the next state depends only on the current state and not on any past states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov chains have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Markov property: The probability of transitioning to the next state depends only on the current state and not on any past states.\n",
    "- State space: The set of all possible states that the system can be in.\n",
    "- Transition probabilities: The probabilities of moving from one state to another state.\n",
    "- Transition probability matrix: A matrix that represents the transition probabilities from one state to another.\n",
    "- Steady-state probabilities: The probabilities of being in each state after a long period of time."
