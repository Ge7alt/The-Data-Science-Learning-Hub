# The Data Science Learning Hub

This repository contains resources and materials for a data science bootcamp. The bootcamp is designed to teach individuals the fundamentals of data science. In this bootcamp, you'll learn the foundational skills and tools necessary to work with data, including:

- Introduction to Data Science
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical Inference
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Big Data and Distributed Computing
- Data Visualization and Communication

## Getting Started

To get started with the bootcamp, you'll need to install the following tools:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK
- Scipy
- Simpy
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- Pytorch
- Streamlit

You can install these tools using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a popular distribution of Python that includes all of these packages or you can follow along `pip` as well for the installation. You may copy the code below and run it it the terminal to install all the required packages.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Besides Python and realted packages, The sixth chapter under the title `Miscellaneous` includes different surronding resources that a data scientist should be familiar with. The installation of each of those topics are provided with guidelines in their respective locations.

## Curriculum

The curriculum for the data science bootcamp is organized into the following modules:

- [Python Programming Language](https://github.com/arunism/The-Data-Science-Learning-Hub/tree/master/01-Python)
- [Mathematics for Data Science](https://github.com/arunism/The-Data-Science-Learning-Hub/tree/master/02-Mathematics)
- [Data Engineering](https://github.com/arunism/The-Data-Science-Learning-Hub/tree/master/03-Data-Engineering)
- [Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/arunism/The-Data-Science-Learning-Hub/tree/master/04-Machine-Learning)
- [Deep Learning and Neural Networks](https://github.com/arunism/The-Data-Science-Learning-Hub/tree/master/05-Deep-Learning)
- [Miscellaneous Topics](https://github.com/arunism/The-Data-Science-Learning-Hub/tree/master/06-Miscellaneous)

Each module includes a set of lectures and exercises to help you learn and apply the concepts covered in the module.
