# Data Science Bootcamp

This repository contains resources and materials for a data science bootcamp. The bootcamp is designed to teach individuals the fundamentals of data science. In this bootcamp, you'll learn the foundational skills and tools necessary to work with data, including:

- Introduction to Data Science
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical Inference
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Big Data and Distributed Computing
- Data Visualization and Communication

## Getting Started

To get started with the bootcamp, you'll need to install the following tools:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
