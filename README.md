Each module includes a set of lectures and exercises to help you learn and apply the concepts covered in the module.

## Getting Started

To get started with the bootcamp, you'll need to install the following tools:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK
- Scipy
- Simpy
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- Pytorch
- Streamlit

You can install these tools using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a popular distribution of Python that includes all of these packages or you can follow along `pip` as well for the installation. You may copy the code below and run it it the terminal to install all the required packages.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Besides Python and realted packages, The sixth chapter under the title `Miscellaneous` includes different surronding resources that a data scientist should be familiar with. The installation of each of those topics are provided with guidelines in their respective locations.
