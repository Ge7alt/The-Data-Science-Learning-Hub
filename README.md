# The Data Science Learning Hub

This repository contains resources and materials for a data science bootcamp. The bootcamp is designed to teach individuals the fundamentals of data science. In this bootcamp, you'll learn the foundational skills and tools necessary to work with data, including:

- Introduction to Data Science
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical Inference
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Big Data and Distributed Computing
- Data Visualization and Communication

## Getting Started

To get started with the bootcamp, you'll need to install the following tools:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas

- Pytorch

You can install these tools using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a popular distribution of Python that includes all of these packages or you can follow along `pip` as well for the installation.

## Curriculum

The curriculum for the data science bootcamp is organized into the following modules:

- Python Programming Language
- Mathematics for Data Science
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Each module includes a set of lectures and exercises to help you learn and apply the concepts covered in the module.
