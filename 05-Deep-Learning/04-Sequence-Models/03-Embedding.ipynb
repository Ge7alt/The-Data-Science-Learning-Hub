    "# Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of natural language processing (NLP), \"embeddings\" refer to dense vector representations of words (or sometimes phrases and sentences) in a continuous vector space. These vector representations are learned through unsupervised machine learning techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText, where words with similar meanings or appearing in similar contexts are mapped to vectors that are close together in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional NLP, words have been typically represented using one-hot encoding, where each word is represented as a sparse binary vector, with a 1 in the position corresponding to the word's index in the vocabulary and 0s everywhere else. However, one-hot encoded vectors suffer from several limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Dimensionality:** One-hot encoded vectors are very high-dimensional, with the dimensionality equal to the size of the vocabulary. This leads to increased computational complexity and storage requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of Semantic Information:** One-hot vectors do not capture any semantic relationships between words. Each word is treated as an isolated entity with no notion of similarity or relatedness to other words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings address these limitations and offer several advantages in NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low-dimensional Dense Representations:** Word embeddings are low-dimensional dense vectors, typically ranging from 50 to 300 dimensions, making them computationally efficient and memory-friendly compared to one-hot vectors.\n",
    "- **Semantic Relationships:** Embeddings capture semantic relationships between words. Words with similar meanings or appearing in similar contexts will have similar vector representations, enabling models to understand the meaning and context of words.\n",
    "- **Generalization:** Word embeddings allow NLP models to generalize better across different tasks and datasets. Pre-trained word embeddings can be used as features for various downstream tasks, even if the training data for the downstream task is limited.\n",
    "- **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words:** Word embeddings provide representations for words not seen during training (OOV words) by generalizing from the context of other words.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Once trained, word embeddings can be efficiently stored and reused, which is especially important for large-scale NLP applications.\n",
    "- **Capturing Analogies:** Word embeddings can capture analogical relationships like \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" ≈ \"queen,\" allowing models to perform analogy-based reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a popular technique for learning word embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, allowing machines to understand and work with words in a more meaningful way. Word2Vec was introduced by researchers at Google in 2013, and it has since become one of the foundational techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and other related fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind Word2Vec is to represent each word in a high-dimensional vector space, where words with similar meanings or contexts are located close to each other. The key intuition behind Word2Vec is the distributional hypothesis, which posits that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. For example, in the sentences \"I love cats\" and \"I adore felines,\" the words \"love\" and \"adore\" are likely to be used in similar contexts and have similar semantic meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec can be trained using two main architectures: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram. Let's explore each of these in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)\n",
    "CBOW aims to predict a target word based on its surrounding context words. Given a sequence of words in a sentence, CBOW tries to predict the middle word based on the surrounding context words. The context window size determines how many words before and after the target word are considered as the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the sentence: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" If we set the context window size to 2 and assume \"sat\" is the target word, CBOW will use the context words \"The,\" \"cat,\" \"on,\" and \"the\" to predict the word \"sat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture involves the following steps:\n",
    "- Convert the context words to their corresponding word embeddings.\n",
    "- Average these embeddings to create a context vector.\n",
    "- Use this context vector as input to a neural network to predict the target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement it using python. Python provides a package named `gensim` to make our job easy. Let's begin by installing the package.\n",

    "## FastText Word Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "Facebook AI Research lab developed an open-source word-embedding library called `FastText` with the purpose of achieving more accurate and scalable solutions qucikly while processing large text data. Similar to `GloVe` Word Embedding, `FastText` is also the modified version of `Word2Vec`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Word2Vec which feeds individual words to neural network, FastText breaks a word into character n-grams and then feeds those character n-grams to the neural network. For instance: the tri-gram of the word fasttext is:\n",

    "`<fa`, `fas`, `ast`, `stt`, `tte`, `tex`, `ext`, `xt>`\n",
    "\n",

    "**How is FastText better than Word2Vec?**\n",
    "\n",
