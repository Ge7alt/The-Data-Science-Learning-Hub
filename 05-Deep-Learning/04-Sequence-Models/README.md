# Sequence Models

Sequence models are a class of neural networks that are well-suited for handling sequential data, such as time series, natural language, or DNA sequences. They can model dependencies between elements in a sequence and make predictions based on the context. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are commonly used sequence models.

Fundamental topics related to sequence models:
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
- Sequence generation
- Sequence classification
- Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Attention mechanisms
- Machine translation (e.g., using encoder-decoder architectures)
