# Neural Networks

Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons in the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers. Each neuron takes input, performs a computation, and produces an output. Neural networks can learn from data by adjusting the weights and biases associated with each neuron.

Fundamental topics related to neural networks:

- Feedforward Neural Networks
- Backpropagation algorithm
- Activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU, tanh)
- Loss functions (e.g., mean squared error, cross-entropy)
- Regularization techniques (e.g., L1/L2 regularization, dropout)
- Optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent)
- Hyperparameter tuning
