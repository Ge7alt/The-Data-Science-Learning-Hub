# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):

CNNs are a specialized type of neural network commonly used for analyzing visual data, such as images or videos. They are designed to automatically learn and extract relevant features from the input data. CNNs are composed of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Fundamental topics related to CNNs:

- Convolutional layers and filters
- Pooling layers (e.g., max pooling, average pooling)
- Stride and padding
- Activation maps and feature visualization
- Transfer learning and pre-trained models
- Object detection and localization (e.g., using bounding boxes)
- Image segmentation
