    "# Structured Query Language\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases. SQL is used to create, modify and query databases, and is widely used in data analysis, data science and software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL has a few basic components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Keywords`: These are reserved words used in SQL statements, like SELECT, INSERT, and WHERE.\n",
    "- `Clauses`: These are the building blocks of SQL statements. Clauses like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and ORDER BY are used to construct SQL queries.\n",
    "- `Expressions`: These are the parts of a SQL statement that return results. Examples include column names and mathematical expressions.\n",
    "- `Operators`: These are symbols used to compare values or perform mathematical operations. Examples include =, <, >, +, and -.\n",
